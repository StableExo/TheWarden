## 🏗️ Technical Infrastructure Analysis

### 1. High-Performance Bundle Merging

**Multiple Parallel Algorithms:**
```
Searcher Bundle A  ─┐
Searcher Bundle B  ─┼─→ [Parallel Algorithm 1] ─┐
Searcher Bundle C  ─┤   [Parallel Algorithm 2] ─┼─→ [Best Block Selection] → Block Proposal
Searcher Bundle D  ─┘   [Parallel Algorithm 3] ─┘
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Language:** Rust (high performance, memory safety)
- **Approach:** Run multiple merging strategies simultaneously
- **Output:** Select most profitable block construction
- **Latency:** Proprietary low-latency systems (exact specs not public)

**Why This Matters:**
- MEV-Boost auctions require fast block construction
- Multiple algorithms find different optimization paths
- Parallel execution beats sequential approaches
- Higher profitability = winning more blocks

### 2. Titan Relay Infrastructure

- **Testing:** 2-3 days (bundle submission verification)

#### Option 2: Multi-Builder Strategy (Recommended)

**Approach:** Submit bundles to multiple builders simultaneously

```typescript
// Pseudo-code for multi-builder submission
async function submitBundleMultiBuilder(bundle: Bundle) {
  // Note: Percentages represent builder market share, not API success rate
  const results = await Promise.allSettled([
    titanBuilder.submitBundle(bundle),   // 40-50% market share
    flashbotsBuilder.submitBundle(bundle), // 20-30% market share
    bloXrouteBuilder.submitBundle(bundle), // 15-25% market share
    beaverbuildBuilder.submitBundle(bundle) // 5-10% market share
  ]);
  
  // Track which builder included the bundle
  const included = results.find(r => r.status === 'fulfilled' && r.value.included);
  
  // Log builder performance for optimization
  await logBuilderPerformance(included?.builder);
}
```
