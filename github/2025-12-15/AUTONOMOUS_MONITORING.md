# TheWarden Autonomous Monitoring & Diagnostics

## Overview

The autonomous monitoring system allows you to run TheWarden in diagnostic mode with automatic log analysis, issue detection, and parameter adjustment recommendations. This is particularly useful for:

- **Initial deployment** - Understanding if TheWarden is working correctly on mainnet
- **Troubleshooting** - Identifying configuration issues, RPC problems, or strategy logic issues
- **Parameter tuning** - Finding optimal settings for your specific environment
- **Determining issue source** - Whether problems are environmental, strategy logic, or consciousness-related

## Features

### 🔄 Automated Cycle
- Runs TheWarden for **2-minute intervals**
- Automatically stops and analyzes logs
- Provides real-time diagnostic insights
- Generates parameter recommendations

### 🔍 Comprehensive Analysis
The monitoring system analyzes logs for:
- **Error patterns** (RPC errors, gas issues, slippage problems)
- **Opportunity detection** (are opportunities being found?)
- **Execution rate** (are opportunities being executed?)
- **Gas cost issues** (is gas too expensive?)
- **Pool loading** (are DEX pools being detected?)
- **Consciousness activity** (is AI making decisions?)
- **Configuration effectiveness** (current parameter analysis)

### 📊 Diagnostic Categories

#### Environmental Issues
- RPC connectivity and rate limiting
- Network timeouts
- API key problems
- Chain configuration errors

#### Strategy Logic Issues
- Profitability thresholds too restrictive
- Gas cost limits too tight
- Slippage parameters too conservative
- Insufficient liquidity thresholds

#### Consciousness Issues
- AI not evaluating opportunities
- Cognitive modules not reaching consensus
- Emergence detection not triggering
- Ethical filters blocking execution

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run in monitoring mode (infinite iterations):
```bash
./TheWarden --monitor
```

Or use npm:
```bash
npm run monitor
```

Or use the diagnostic alias:
```bash
./TheWarden --diagnostic
```

### Limited Iterations

Run for specific number of iterations (e.g., 10 cycles = 20 minutes):
```bash
MAX_ITERATIONS=10 ./TheWarden --monitor
```

Run for quick test (3 cycles = 6 minutes):
```bash
MAX_ITERATIONS=3 ./TheWarden --monitor
```

### Dry Run Mode

Run in simulation mode with no real transactions:
```bash
npm run monitor -- --dry-run
```

Or combined with limited iterations:
```bash
MAX_ITERATIONS=1 npm run monitor -- --dry-run
```

### Offline Cache Only Mode

Run using only cached pool data (no RPC calls). This is useful for:
- Debugging the opportunity detection logic without network access
- Testing the graph-search algorithm on previously cached data
- Fast iteration during development

```bash
npm run monitor -- --dry-run --offline-cache-only
```

**Note:** You must first run `npm run preload:pools` to cache pool data before using offline mode.

Combined example for debugging:
```bash
MAX_ITERATIONS=1 npm run monitor -- --dry-run --offline-cache-only
```

### Stopping

Press `Ctrl+C` at any time to stop monitoring and generate final recommendations.

```

## Interpreting Results

### Healthy Operation

A well-configured TheWarden should show:
- ✅ Opportunities found (>0 per 2-minute interval)
- ✅ Some executions (if profitable and DRY_RUN=false)
- ✅ Pool activity in logs
- ✅ Consciousness evaluation entries
- ✅ Low error count (<5 per interval)
- ✅ No RPC errors

### Configuration Needed

Signs you need to adjust parameters:
- ⚠️ Opportunities found: 0 (thresholds too high)
- ⚠️ Gas issues: >3 (gas limits too low)
- ⚠️ RPC errors: >5 (RPC problems)
- ⚠️ Execution rate: 0% (various issues)

### Critical Issues

Indicators of serious problems:
- ❌ No pool activity at all
- ❌ Constant RPC failures
- ❌ Build or startup errors
- ❌ Missing configuration values

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Interval

The default 2-minute interval can be adjusted by editing the script:
```bash
# In scripts/autonomous-monitor.sh
RUN_INTERVAL=300  # 5 minutes instead of 2
```

### Custom Analysis

You can extend the analysis by adding patterns to the `analyze_logs()` function in `scripts/autonomous-monitor.sh`.

### Integration with CI/CD

Run monitoring in CI/CD pipelines:
```bash
# Run 3 iterations and check exit code
MAX_ITERATIONS=3 ./TheWarden --monitor
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Monitoring passed"
fi
```

## Best Practices

### Initial Deployment

1. **Start with monitoring mode**
   ```bash
   MAX_ITERATIONS=5 ./TheWarden --monitor
   ```

2. **Review diagnostics** in `logs/diagnostics.log`

3. **Apply recommendations** from `logs/parameter-recommendations.txt`

4. **Re-run monitoring** to verify improvements

5. **Switch to normal mode** when satisfied
   ```bash
   ./TheWarden
   ```

### Troubleshooting Workflow

1. **Run monitoring for 30 minutes** (15 iterations)
   ```bash
   MAX_ITERATIONS=15 ./TheWarden --monitor
   ```

2. **Check recommendation categories**:
   - RPC_ISSUE → Fix connectivity
   - GAS_ISSUE → Adjust gas parameters
   - OPPORTUNITY_ISSUE → Lower thresholds
   - EXECUTION_ISSUE → Check DRY_RUN and filters
   - CONSCIOUSNESS_ISSUE → Enable AI features
   - POOL_ISSUE → Run preload:pools

3. **Apply changes incrementally** (one category at a time)

4. **Validate each change** with another monitoring run

### Production Monitoring

For ongoing production monitoring:
```bash
# Run infinite monitoring
./TheWarden --monitor

# Or use a cronjob for periodic checks
0 */6 * * * cd /path/to/project && MAX_ITERATIONS=3 ./TheWarden --monitor
```

## FAQ

**Q: How long should I run monitoring mode?**  
A: Start with 5-10 iterations (10-20 minutes) to identify major issues. For comprehensive tuning, run 15-30 iterations (30-60 minutes).

**Q: Will this execute real transactions?**  
A: It respects your `DRY_RUN` setting. Set `DRY_RUN=true` for safe testing, `DRY_RUN=false` for real execution.

**Q: Can I adjust the 2-minute interval?**  
A: Yes, edit `RUN_INTERVAL` in `scripts/autonomous-monitor.sh`. Longer intervals (5-10 minutes) may provide more data per iteration.

**Q: What if I see "No issues detected"?**  
A: Great! Your configuration is likely optimal. Switch to normal mode: `./TheWarden`

**Q: How do I know if it's my config vs. the strategy logic?**  
A: The monitoring system categorizes issues:
- `RPC_ISSUE`, `GAS_ISSUE`, `POOL_ISSUE` = Environmental/config
- `OPPORTUNITY_ISSUE`, `EXECUTION_ISSUE` = Strategy parameters
- `CONSCIOUSNESS_ISSUE` = AI/consciousness configuration

**Q: Can I run this on testnet?**  
A: Yes! Set `CHAIN_ID` to a testnet (e.g., 84532 for Base Sepolia) in your `.env` file.
