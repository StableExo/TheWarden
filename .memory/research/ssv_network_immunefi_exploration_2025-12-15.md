## SSV Network Technical Architecture

### What is SSV Network?

SSV Network implements **Distributed Validator Technology (DVT)** for Ethereum staking, revolutionizing validator infrastructure through:

1. **Key Splitting**: Validator keys split into "KeyShares" using threshold cryptography (MPC)
2. **Distributed Signing**: Multiple independent operators (typically 4) hold shares
3. **Threshold Consensus**: Subset (e.g., 3 of 4) must collaborate to sign blocks/attestations
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Validators continue operating even if operators fail (99%+ uptime improvement)
5. **Non-Custodial**: Stakers retain full control; operators only get non-reconstructable shares

**Network Scale** (as of 2025):
- 📊 $15B+ ETH staked
- 👥 1,000+ node operators
- 🏢 Major integrations: Lido, EigenLayer, EtherFi, Kiln
- 🌍 Institutional-grade uptime and reliability

### Technical Components

#### 1. Consensus Mechanism
- **QBFT (Quick Byzantine Fault Tolerance)**: Coordinates operators
- **Active-Active Redundancy**: Continues operation during operator failures/malicious behavior
- **Threshold Cryptography**: Multi-Party Computation (MPC) for key management

#### 2. Smart Contract Architecture

**Design Pattern**: EIP-2535 Diamond Multi-Facet Proxy (modified for Etherscan compatibility)

**Core Contracts**:

```
SSVNetwork (Main Entry Point - UUPS Upgradeable)
├── SSVProxy (Proxy pattern for delegation)
├── SSVNetworkViews (Read-only queries)
└── Modules (Non-upgradeable, stateless logic)
    ├── SSVClusters (Cluster management)
    ├── SSVOperators (Operator registration/management)
    ├── SSVOperatorsWhitelist (Whitelist functionality)
    ├── SSVDAO (Governance)
    └── SSVViews (View functions)

Libraries
├── SSVStorage (Diamond storage pattern)
├── SSVStorageProtocol (Protocol-level storage)
├── ClusterLib (Cluster operations)
├── OperatorLib (Operator operations)
├── ProtocolLib (Protocol utilities)
├── ValidatorLib (Validator operations)
├── CoreLib (Core functionality)
└── Types (Type definitions)

Token
└── SSVToken (ERC20 for operator payments)
```

**Key Architectural Features**:
- ✅ **Modularity**: Evolve functionalities without contract size limits
- ✅ **Upgradeability**: DAO-controlled UUPS upgrades
- ✅ **Resilient Innovation**: Easy integration for developers
- ✅ **Fallback Delegation**: Automatic delegation to SSVViews module

#### 3. Storage Pattern

**Diamond Storage Pattern**:
- State variables isolated in libraries (`SSVStorage`, `SSVStorageProtocol`)
- Prevents storage collision during upgrades
- Enables modular state management

**Key Storage Variables**:
```solidity
struct StorageData {
    IERC20 token;
    mapping(SSVModules => address) ssvContracts;
    // ... additional state
}

struct StorageProtocol {
    uint64 minimumBlocksBeforeLiquidation;
    uint256 minimumLiquidationCollateral;
    uint32 validatorsPerOperatorLimit;
    uint64 declareOperatorFeePeriod;
    uint64 executeOperatorFeePeriod;
    uint64 operatorMaxFeeIncrease;
    // ... additional protocol state
}
```

### Key Functions & Access Control

#### SSVNetwork.sol (Main Contract)

**Initialization** (One-time):
```solidity
function initialize(
    IERC20 token_,
    ISSVOperators ssvOperators_,
    ISSVClusters ssvClusters_,
    ISSVDAO ssvDAO_,
    ISSVViews ssvViews_,
    uint64 minimumBlocksBeforeLiquidation_,
    uint256 minimumLiquidationCollateral_,
    uint32 validatorsPerOperatorLimit_,
    uint64 declareOperatorFeePeriod_,
    uint64 executeOperatorFeePeriod_,
    uint64 operatorMaxFeeIncrease_
) external override initializer onlyProxy
```
- ⚠️ **Critical**: Must be called exactly once
- ✅ Protected by `initializer` modifier (OpenZeppelin)
- ✅ Protected by `onlyProxy` modifier

**Upgrade Authorization**:
```solidity
function _authorizeUpgrade(address) internal override onlyOwner {}
```
- ⚠️ **Critical**: Only owner can upgrade
- ✅ Uses `onlyOwner` from Ownable2StepUpgradeable
- ✅ Two-step ownership transfer prevents accidents

**Delegation Pattern**:
```solidity
fallback() external {
    _delegate(SSVStorage.load().ssvContracts[SSVModules.SSV_VIEWS]);
}
```
- ⚠️ **Security**: All unknown calls delegated to SSVViews
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Module address tampering could redirect calls

**Operator Functions** (Delegated to modules):
- `registerOperator()` - Register new operator
- `removeOperator()` - Remove operator
- `setOperatorsWhitelists()` - Configure whitelists
- `removeOperatorsWhitelists()` - Remove whitelists
- `declareOperatorFee()` - Declare fee change
- `executeOperatorFee()` - Execute fee change
- `withdrawOperatorEarnings()` - Withdraw earnings
- `reduceOperatorFee()` - Reduce fees

**Cluster Functions** (Delegated to modules):
- `registerValidator()` - Register validator
- `removeValidator()` - Remove validator
- `liquidate()` - Liquidate underfunded cluster
- `reactivate()` - Reactivate liquidated cluster
- `deposit()` - Deposit SSV tokens
- `withdraw()` - Withdraw SSV tokens

## Potential Vulnerability Areas

### Critical Research Focus Areas

#### 1. **Upgrade Path Security** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Questions to Investigate**:
- Is there a timelock on upgrades?
- Is multi-sig required for `_authorizeUpgrade()`?
- Can storage be corrupted during upgrades?
- Are there emergency upgrade mechanisms?

**Potential Issues**:
- Instant malicious upgrade
- Storage layout changes causing corruption
- Proxy implementation mismatch

**Test Scenarios**:
```solidity
// Test 1: Attempt unauthorized upgrade
vm.prank(attacker);
ssvNetwork.upgradeTo(maliciousImplementation);
// Expected: Revert with "Ownable: caller is not the owner"

// Test 2: Check storage preservation
// Upgrade to new implementation
// Verify critical storage intact
```

#### 2. **Module Address Manipulation** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Questions to Investigate**:
- Can `ssvContracts` mapping be tampered with?

s.ssvContracts[SSVModules.SSV_OPERATORS] = attackerContract;
// Check if unauthorized change is possible
```

#### 3. **Fee Manipulation & Gaming** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Questions to Investigate**:
- Can operators bypass `operatorMaxFeeIncrease`?
- Is there a way to front-run fee declarations?
- Can fee execution window be exploited?

**Potential Issues**:

- Economic attacks via fee manipulation
- Front-running for profit

**Test Scenarios**:
```solidity
// Test: Attempt to exceed max fee increase
uint256 currentFee = 100;
uint256 maxIncrease = 10; // 10%
uint256 newFee = 200; // 100% increase (should fail)
vm.expectRevert();

```

#### 4. **Liquidation Exploitation** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Questions to Investigate**:
- Can clusters be prematurely liquidated?
- Is liquidation calculation vulnerable to manipulation?

**Potential Issues**:
- Griefing via premature liquidation
- Avoiding legitimate liquidation
- MEV extraction from liquidations

**Test Scenarios**:
```solidity
// Test: Attempt premature liquidation
uint256 currentBlock = block.number;
uint256 minimumBlocks = 100;
// Try liquidating before minimum blocks elapsed
vm.expectRevert();
ssvClusters.liquidate(clusterData);
```

#### 5. **Validator Per Operator Limit Bypass** ⭐⭐⭐

**Questions to Investigate**:

    }
}
```

#### 7. **Initialization Replay** ⭐⭐⭐

- Is there a way to reset initialization?
- Are storage gaps properly sized?

**Potential Issues**:
- Re-initialization attack
