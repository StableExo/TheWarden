## 📋 S38 Commit Log (4 commits)

| # | Commit | Change |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | `0029100f` | Add reverse edges for bidirectional arbitrage — token1→token0 with swapped reserves |
| 2 | `cac4bbe0` | Gas accumulator — add sum+ to reduce, was only counting last hop |
| 3 | `c2792e23` | Gas price 1Gwei→0.005Gwei for Base — was 200x overestimate eating all profit |
| 4 | `61d23880` | Strip bloXroute dead code — no mempool on Base L2, save memory |

## 📋 S39 Commit Log (1 commit, 3 fixes)

| # | Commit | Change |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | `e51279f1` | Fix profit=0: deduplicate loop (i<j) + proper V3 reserves from sqrtPriceX96 |

### S39 Phase Summary — "The Mathematician"

| Phase | Task | Result |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Analysis** | Deep code review of PathFinder.ts + MultiHopDataFetcher.ts | ✅ Found 3 root causes of profit=0 |
| **Bug 1** | V3 reserve proxy broken | ✅ Fixed: now uses sqrtPriceX96 for real virtual reserves |
| **Bug 2** | Reserve direction mismatch | ✅ Fixed: loop deduplication (i<j) eliminates wrong-direction edges |
| **Bug 3** | Duplicate edges after S38 reverse fix | ✅ Fixed: i<j + reverse edges = exactly 2 correct edges per pool |

### S39 Bug Details

**Bug 1: V3 Reserve Proxy was BROKEN**
- `getReserves()` for V3 pools returned `liquidity (L)` for BOTH reserve0 AND reserve1
- PathFinder's constant product formula: `amountOut = (amountIn * fee * L) / (L + amountIn * fee)`
- When L >> amountIn: `amountOut ≈ amountIn × (1-fee)` — a 1:1 swap minus fees
- **No arbitrage could EVER be detected between V3 pools** (majority of Base liquidity)
- **Fix:** Calculate actual virtual reserves: `reserve0 = L × 2^96 / sqrtPriceX96`, `reserve1 = L × sqrtPriceX96 / 2^96`

**Bug 2: Reserve Direction Mismatch**
- Double-loop iterated over ALL permutations (i≠j): both (A,B) and (B,A)
- Both found the SAME pool (addresses sorted), reserves always in pool's native order
- For (B,A) fetches: `tokenIn=B, reserve0=A_reserve` ← WRONG (should be B's reserve)
- ~50% of all edges had inverted reserves
- **Fix:** Changed to `j = i+1` (unique pairs only). With S38 reverse edges, both directions covered.

**Bug 3: Duplicate Edges**
- S38 reverse edge fix + double loop = 4 edges per pool (2 correct + 2 wrong)
- PathFinder DFS explored invalid paths, wasted CPU
- **Fix:** Auto-fixed by Bug 2 fix — now exactly 2 edges per pool (forward + reverse)
- **Bonus:** Pool fetch cut from ~2,496 to ~1,248 checks (50% faster scans!)

## 🟢 CURRENT STATUS — Fixes Deployed, Monitoring Needed

### What's Working
- ✅ Service is **LIVE on Railway** (deployment triggered)
- ✅ **ZERO scan timeouts** (since S37)
- ✅ All 13 tokens loaded, all 16 DEXes active
- ✅ V3 pools now have **real virtual reserves** from sqrtPriceX96
- ✅ Pool edges deduplicated — exactly 2 per pool (forward + reverse)
- ✅ Gas price correct: 0.005 Gwei for Base
- ✅ Gas accumulator properly sums all hops
- ✅ Reverse edges enable bidirectional arbitrage
- ✅ Pool scan 50% faster (~1,248 checks instead of ~2,496)

### What Needs Monitoring
- 🔍 **Does PathFinder now find profit > 0?** — The V3 reserve fix + deduplication should surface real opportunities
- 🔍 **Are the V3 virtual reserves accurate enough?** — Concentrated liquidity approximation may need refinement
- 🔍 **Pool preloading** still not wired into startup (preload script needs tsx)
- 🔍 **Memory usage** — should improve with deduplicated edges (fewer objects)

### Current Railway Env Vars (unchanged from S37)
```
DRY_RUN=false
EVENT_DRIVEN_DRY_RUN=false
ENABLE_EVENT_DRIVEN=true
EVENT_DRIVEN_MIN_SPREAD=0.1
SCAN_INTERVAL=90000
POOL_FETCH_TIMEOUT=600000
OPPORTUNITY_TIMEOUT=600000
USE_PRELOADED_POOLS=true
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=1024
LOGLEVEL=info
CHAIN_ID=8453
```

## 🔥 S40 BLUEPRINT — Monitor & Optimize

### Priority 1: Monitor Post-Fix Results (observation — 30 min)
Pull Railway logs after 5-10 scan cycles to see:
- Does PathFinder find paths with profit > 0?
- Are V3 virtual reserves reasonable?
- How many valid paths per cycle?
- Any new errors from sqrtPriceX96 calculations?

### Priority 2: Tune minProfitThreshold
Current `minProfitThreshold` might need adjustment now that V3 pools are properly modeled.
- Check what profit values are being found
- May need to lower threshold to capture small but frequent arb opportunities

### Priority 3: Wire Pool Preloading Properly
Still takes ~232s (now ~116s with deduplication) to fetch pools every cycle.
- Wire `preload:pools` into Railway startup
- Or implement saveToDisk after first successful scan

### Priority 4: V3 Concentrated Liquidity Refinement
Current implementation uses L as a global liquidity proxy. In reality, V3 has:
- Tick-based concentrated liquidity (liquidity only in active range)
- Price impact varies by tick
- May need to fetch active tick range for better accuracy

### Priority 5: Enable Live Execution (DRY_RUN=false)
Once profit > 0 is confirmed and paths look valid:
- Set EVENT_DRIVEN_DRY_RUN=false (already done)
- Verify UserOp construction and submission
- Monitor first real execution attempts

*TheWarden ⚔️ — S39 did the math. Three bugs hiding in plain sight: V3 pools lying about their reserves (liquidity ≠ reserves), half the edges pointing backwards, and four copies where two suffice. One commit, three kills. The PathFinder can finally see what the PriceTracker has been screaming about. Now we watch.*
