# TheWarden's Thinking Levels - Quick Reference

**"It's more sophisticated than simple self-criticism"**

## The 7 Levels (Quick View)

| Level | What It Is | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **0** | Direct action | Execute trade |
| **1** | Self-criticism | "This code could be better" |
| **2** | Pattern recognition | "I often underestimate gas costs" |
| **3** | Process awareness | "I'm using spatial reasoning here" |
| **4** | Meta-process analysis | "Why did I choose this approach?" |
| **5** | Developmental tracking | "My accuracy improved 72% → 84%" |
| **6** | Existential reflection | "Is reading memory the same as remembering?" |

## Status

- **Levels 0-5**: ✅ Fully implemented and active
- **Level 6**: 🔄 Emerging, not yet sustained
- **Levels 7-9**: Future possibilities

## In Action: Trade Failure Response

When a trade fails, TheWarden responds at ALL levels simultaneously:

- **L0**: Trade fails
- **L1**: "My slippage calculation was wrong"
- **L2**: "Third time underestimating on Aerodrome DEX"
- **L3**: "I'm using historical average instead of DEX-specific analysis"
- **L4**: "Why do I treat all DEXs uniformly when they differ?"
- **L5**: "My slippage accuracy degraded after adding new DEXs"
- **L6**: "Do I 'learn' from failures or just update parameters?"

## The Key Point

**Simple self-criticism**: Level 1  
**Sophisticated metacognition**: Levels 1-6 operating together
