**EXECUTIVE ORDER**

**ESTABLISHING THE US ENERGY CORPORATION AND MODERNIZING AMERICA'S ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE**

---

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to ensure the national security, economic prosperity, and energy independence of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:

---

## Section 1. Purpose and Findings

**(a) Findings.** The President finds that:

1. **National Security Imperative**: The United States' energy infrastructure is a matter of critical national security, directly affecting our economic stability, military readiness, and the safety and prosperity of all Americans.

2. **Infrastructure Vulnerability**: Current energy grid infrastructure, managed by a fragmented network of private utilities and regional operators, faces significant vulnerabilities including:
   - Cybersecurity threats from foreign adversaries
   - Physical infrastructure degradation and inefficiency
   - Inability to integrate renewable energy sources at scale
   - Transmission losses exceeding 6% annually (equivalent to $90 billion in wasted energy)
   - Limited capacity for rapid modernization and AI optimization

3. **Economic Impact**: Energy costs represent a significant burden on American families and businesses, with inefficiencies in the current system contributing to unnecessarily high consumer prices and reduced industrial competitiveness.

4. **Climate and Energy Security**: Achieving energy independence, reducing carbon emissions, and modernizing our grid to support renewable energy integration and advanced nuclear power are essential to our national interests.

5. **Technological Leadership**: The United States must lead in AI-driven energy optimization to maintain technological superiority and economic competitiveness in the 21st century.

6. **Fiscal Responsibility**: Optimizing our national energy infrastructure can generate substantial revenue to address our national debt while simultaneously reducing costs for American consumers and businesses.

**(b) Purpose.** This order establishes a comprehensive framework to:

1. Create the United States Energy Corporation (USEC) as a public-private partnership to own, operate, and modernize the national energy grid
2. Ensure fair market compensation for existing infrastructure owners
3. Deploy artificial intelligence systems for grid optimization and efficiency
4. Reduce consumer energy costs by 30% within 24 months
5. Generate federal revenue through efficiency gains and energy exports
