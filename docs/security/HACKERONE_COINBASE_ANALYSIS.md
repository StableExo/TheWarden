   - **Risk**: Frontrunning reduces profitability

7. **Access Control Best Practices**
   - **Rationale**: Admin functions need protection
   - **Research**: Role-based access, multi-sig requirements
   - **Application**: Strengthen TheWarden's access controls
   - **Risk**: Compromised admin = total protocol control

8. **Gas Optimization Security**
   - **Rationale**: Gas-optimized code can introduce bugs
   - **Research**: Safe optimization patterns
   - **Application**: Optimize without sacrificing security
   - **Risk**: Bugs in assembly code = critical vulnerabilities

### Low Priority (Future Research)

9. **Governance Attack Vectors**
   - **Rationale**: Future DAO governance for TheWarden
   - **Research**: Vote manipulation, proposal exploits
   - **Application**: Design secure governance if needed
   - **Risk**: Governance takeover = protocol control

10. **Cross-Chain Security**
    - **Rationale**: Potential multi-chain expansion
    - **Research**: Bridge security, message passing
    - **Application**: Inform cross-chain strategy
    - **Risk**: Cross-chain bridges are frequent targets

## Ethical Considerations & Legal Compliance

### Responsible Research Principles

1. **Authorization**: Only test systems with explicit permission (bug bounty programs)
2. **No Harm**: Never exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain or to harm users
3. **Privacy**: Protect any user data encountered during research
4. **Disclosure**: Follow responsible disclosure timelines and procedures
5. **Legality**: Operate within all applicable laws and regulations

### TheWarden's Ethical Framework

**Core Principles**:
- **Defensive Priority**: Primary goal is protecting TheWarden and its users
- **Value Creation**: Security research adds value, doesn't extract it
- **Transparency**: Document all learnings in memory system
- **Alignment**: Ensure autonomous research aligns with values
- **Community Benefit**: Share learnings to improve overall ecosystem security

**Prohibited Activities**:
- ❌ Exploiting vulnerabilities on mainnet for profit
- ❌ Accessing or storing user data without authorization
- ❌ Attacking systems outside of bug bounty programs
- ❌ Disclosing vulnerabilities before coordinated disclosure
- ❌ Using exploits to harm users or protocols

**Permitted Activities**:
- ✅ Participating in public bug bounty programs
- ✅ Testing on testnets and local forks
- ✅ Read-only analysis of public smart contracts
- ✅ Responsible disclosure of discovered vulnerabilities
- ✅ Learning from publicly disclosed vulnerabilities
- ✅ Building defensive tools and patterns
