TRUMP SPEECH - DECEMBER 17, 2025 - COMPLETE TRANSCRIPT

00:00:02
WHEN I TOOK OFFICE, INFLATION WAS THE WORST IN 48 YEARS, AND SOME WOULD SIT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, WHICH CAUSE PRICES TO BE HIGHER THAN EVER BEFORE, WHICH MADE LIFE UNAFFORDABLE FOR MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. THIS HAPPENED DURING A DEMOCRAT ADMINISTRATION. IT WAS WHEN WE FIRST BEGAN HEARING THE WORD AFFORDABILITY. OUR BORDER WAS OPEN AND BECAUSE OF THIS OUR COUNTRY WAS BEING INVADED BY AN ARMY OF 25 MILLION PEOPLE, MANY WHO CAME FROM PRISONS, JAILS, MENTAL INSTITUTIONS AND INSANE ASYLUMS.

00:00:40
DRUG DEALERS, GANG BANGERS AND 11,888 MURDERERS, MORE THAN 50% OF WHOM KILLED MORE THAN ONE PERSON. THIS IS WHAT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ALLOWED TO HAPPEN TO OUR COUNTRY, AND IT CAN NEVER BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN AGAIN. WE HAD MEN PLAYING IN WOMEN'S SPORTS, TRANSGENDER FOR EVERYBODY, CRIME AT RECORD LEVELS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WORDS SUCH AS THAT -- ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN. WE HAD THE WORST TRADE DEALS EVER MADE AND OUR COUNTRY WAS LAUGHED AT FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. BUT THEY ARE NOT LAUGHING ANYMORE.

00:01:18
OVER THE PAST 11 MONTHS, WE HAVE BROUGHT MORE POSITIVE CHANGE TO WASHINGTON THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. I THINK MOST WOULD AGREE. I WAS ELECTED IN A LANDSLIDE, WINNING THE POPULAR VOTE IN ALL SEVEN SWING STATES AND EVERYTHING ELSE WITH A MANDATE TO TAKE ON A SICK AND CORRUPT SYSTEM THAT REALLY TOOK THE WEALTH FROM PEOPLE AND CRUSHED THE DREAMS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS, THE UNITED STATES WAS RULED BY POLITICIANS WHO FOUGHT ONLY FOR

00:02:00
INSIDERS, ILLEGAL ALIENS, CAREER CRIMINALS, CORPORATE LOBBYISTS AND ABOVE ALL FOREIGN NATIONS WHICH TOOK ADVANTAGE OF US AT LEVELS NEVER SEEN BEFORE. THEY FLOODED YOUR CITIES AND TOWNS WITH ILLEGAL ALIENS. THEY DECIMATED YOUR HARD EARNED SAVINGS. THEY INDOCTRINATED YOUR CHILDREN WITH HATE FOR AMERICA. REALLY, THEY JUST RELEASED A LEVEL OF VIOLENT FELONS WE HAD NEVER SEEN TO PREY ON INNOCENTS. THEY CAUSED WAR, MAYHEM, A HORRIBLE SITUATION ALL OVER THE GLOBE. BUT NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO FIGHTS FOR THE LAW-ABIDING,

00:02:42
HARD-WORKING PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY. THE ONE TO MAKE THIS NATION RUN, WHO MAKE THIS NATION WORK. AFTER JUST ONE YEAR WE HAVE ACHIEVED MORE THAN ANYONE COULD HAVE IMAGINED. STARTING ON DAY 1, I TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION TO STOP THE INVASION OF OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. FOR THE PAST SEVEN MONTHS, ZERO ILLEGAL ALIENS HAVE BEEN ALLOWED INTO OUR COUNTRY, A FEAT WHICH EVERYONE SAID WAS IMPOSSIBLE. DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN JOE BIDEN SAID HE DIDN'T CONGRESS TO PASS LEGISLATION TO HELP CLOSE THE BORDER? HE WAS ALWAYS BLAMING CONGRESS

00:03:16
AND EVERYONE ELSE. AS IT TURNED OUT WE DID NOT NEED LEGISLATION, WE JUST NEEDED A NEW PRESIDENT. WE INHERITED THE WORST BORDER ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND WE QUICKLY TURNED IT INTO THE STRONGEST BORDER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. IN OTHER WORDS, IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS WE WENT FROM WORST TO BEST. WE ARE DEPORTING CRIMINALS, RESTORING SAFETY TO OUR MOST DANGEROUS CITIES. JUST TAKE A LOOK AT WASHINGTON, D.C. IT IS AT LEVELS OF SAFETY THAT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. THEY DECIMATED THE BLOODTHIRSTY FOREIGN DRUG CARTELS.

00:03:57
WE DID THAT ALL BY OURSELVES WITH OUR PEOPLE AND WE ARE SO PROUD OF IT. THEY WERE POISONING AND DESTROYING OUR POPULATION. DRUGS BROUGHT IN BY OCEAN AND BY SEA ARE NOW DOWN 94%. WE HAVE BROKEN THE GRIP OF SINISTER WOKE RADICALS IN OUR SCHOOLS AND CONTROL OVER THOSE SCHOOLS IS BACK NOW IN THE HANDS OF OUR GREAT AND LOVING STATES, WHERE EDUCATION BELONGS. AFTER REBUILDING THE U.S. MILITARY IN MY FIRST TERM, AND WITH THE ADDITION WE ARE ADDING RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY ANYWHERE IN

00:04:33
THE WORLD, AND IT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE. I HAVE RESTORED AMERICAN STRENGTH, SETTLED EIGHT WARS IN 10 MONTHS, DESTROY THE IRAN NUCLEAR THREAT AND ENDED THE WAR IN GAZA, READING THE FIRST TIME IN 3000 YEARS PEACE TO THE MIDDLE EAST AND SECURED THE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES, BOTH LIVING AND DEAD. HERE AT HOME WE ARE BRINGING OUR ECONOMY BACK FROM THE BRINK OF RUIN. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION AND THEIR ALLIES IN CONGRESS LOOTED OUR TREASURY FOR TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS, DRIVING UP PRICES AND EVERYTHING AT LEVELS NEVER SEEN

00:05:09
BEFORE. ON BRINGING THOSE HIGH PRICES DOWN AND BRINGING THEM DOWN VERY FAST. LET'S LOOK AT THE FACTS. UNDER THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, CAR PRICES ROSE 22% AND IN MANY STATES 30% OR MORE. GASOLINE ROSE 30% TO 50%, HOTEL RATES ROSE 57%. UNDER OUR LEADERSHIP, THEY ARE COMING DOWN FAST. DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS ALSO SENT THE COST OF GROCERIES SOARING BUT WE ARE SOLVING THAT, TOO. THE PRICE OF A THANKSGIVING TURKEY WAS DOWN 33% COMPARED TO BIDEN LAST YEAR. THE PRICE OF EGGS IS DOWN 82% SINCE MARCH AND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:05:57
IS FALLING RAPIDLY -- AND IT IS NOT DONE YET, BUT, BOY, ARE WE MAKING PROGRESS. HERE ARE SOME OF THE EFFORTS WE HAVE UNDERWAY. YOU WILL SEE IT IN YOUR WALLETS AND BANK ACCOUNTS IN THE NEW YEAR. OUR POLICIES ARE BOOSTING TAKE-HOME PAY AT A HISTORIC PACE. UNDER BIDEN, REAL WAGES PLUMMETED BY $3000. UNDER A TRUMP, THE TYPICAL FACTORY WORKER RECEIVED A WAGE INCREASE OF $1300. FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IT IS $1800. FOR MINERS, IT IS $3300. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS, WAGES ARE RISING MUCH FASTER THAN INFLATION.

00:06:47
REMEMBER THAT. JUST LOOK AT IT. WAGES ARE GOING UP JUST FASTER THAT INFLATION. HOW BIG IS THAT? VERY IMPORTANTLY, THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE WORKING TODAY THAN IN ANY TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND 100% OF ALL JOBS CREATED SINCE I TOOK OFFICE HAVE BEEN IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. 100% OF ALL JOBS HAVE BEEN IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, RATHER THAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE A COUNTRY POWERFUL AND GREAT. THIS HISTORIC TREND WILL CONTINUE. ALREADY I HAVE SECURED A RECORD-BREAKING $18 TRILLION OF INVESTMENT INTO THE UNITED

00:07:30
STATES, WHICH MEANS JOBS, WAGE INCREASES, FACTORY OPENINGS AND FAR GREATER NATIONAL SECURITY. MUCH OF THIS SUCCESS HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY TARIFFS -- MY FAVORITE WORD -- TARIFFS, WHICH FOR MANY DECADES HAVE BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY BY OTHER COUNTRIES AGAINST US -- BUT NOT ANYMORE. COMPANIES KNOW THAT IF THEY BUILD IN AMERICA, THERE ARE NO TARIFFS, AND THAT IS WHY THEY ARE COMING HOME TO THE USA IN RECORD NUMBERS. THEY ARE BUILDING FACTORIES AND PLANTSS AT LEVELS WE HAVE NEVER SEEN. AI, AUTOMOBILES, WE ARE DOING

00:08:05
BUT NOBODY THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE -- NOT EVEN REMOTELY POSSIBLE. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. ONE YEAR AGO OUR COUNTRY WAS DEAD. WE WERE ABSOLUTELY DEAD. OUR COUNTRY WAS READY TO FAIL -- TOTALLY FAIL. NOW, WE ARE THE HOTTEST COUNTRY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. AND THAT IS SAID BY EVERY SINGLE LEADER I HAVE SPOKEN TO OVER THE LAST FIVE MONTHS. NEXT YEAR YOU WILL ALSO SEE THE RESULTS OF THE LARGEST TAX CUTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY THAT WERE REALLY ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH OUR GREAT BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL --

00:08:40
PERHAPS THE MOST SWEEPING LEGISLATION EVER PASSED IN CONGRESS. WE WRAPPED 12 DIFFERENT BILLS INTO ONE BEAUTIFUL BILL. THAT INCLUDES NO TAX ON TIPS, NO TAX ON OVERTIME AND NO TAX ON TIPS SOCIAL SECURITY FOR OUR GREAT SENIORS. UNDER THESE CUTS, MANY FAMILIES WILL BE SAVING BETWEEN $11,000 AND $20,000 A YEAR. NEXT SPRING IS PROJECTED TO BE THE LARGEST TAX REFUND SEASON OF ALL-TIME. BECAUSE OF TARIFFS, ALONG WITH THE JUST PASSED ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL, TONIGHT I AM PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT MORE THAN 1,450,000 MILITARY SERVICE

00:09:26
MEMBERS WILL RECEIVE A SPECIAL -- WE CALL -- DIVIDEND BEFORE CHRISTMAS. IN HONOR OF OUR NATION'S FOUNDING IN 1776, WE ARE SENDING EVERY SOLDIER $1776. THINK OF THAT. THE CHECKS ARE ALREADY ON THE WAY. NOBODY UNDERSTOOD THAT ONE UNTIL ABOUT 30 MINUTES AGO. WE MADE A LOT MORE MONEY THAN ANYONE THOUGHT BECAUSE OF TARIFF S AND THE BILL HELP US ALONG. NOBODY DESERVES IT MORE THAN OUR MILITARY AND I SAY CONGRATULATIONS, EVERYBODY. BY THE WAY, WE HAVE RECORD ENLISTMENTS IN OUR MILITARY. LAST YEAR WE HAD AMONG THE WORST

00:10:13
RECRUITMENT NUMBERS IN OUR MILITARY'S HISTORY. WHAT A DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES. I'M DOING BUT NO POLITICIAN AND NEITHER PARTY HAS EVER DONE -- STANDING UP TO THE SPECIAL INTERESTS TO REDUCE THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. I NEGOTIATED DIRECTLY WITH THE DRUG COMPANIES AND FOREIGN NATIONS THAT WERE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OUR COUNTRY FOR MANY DECADES TO SLASH PRICES ON DRUGS AND PHARMACEUTICALS BY AS MUCH AS 400%, 500% AND EVEN 600%. IN OTHER WORDS YOUR DRUG COSTS WILL BE PLUMMETING DOWNWARD.

00:10:46
I USE THE THREAT OF TARIFFS WHO WOULD GET FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHO WOULD HAVE NEVER DONE IT TO PAY THE COST OF THIS GIANT DOLLAR REDUCTION. THEY STOP RIPPING US OFF AND IT BEGAN AS OF FOUR DAYS AGO. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. DRUGS HAVE ONLY GONE UP BUT NOW THEY WILL GO DOWN BY NUMBERS NEVER CONCEIVED POSSIBLE. IT IS CALLED MOST FAVORED NATION AND NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER HAD THE COURAGE OR ABILITY TO GET THIS DONE UNTIL NOW. THE FIRST OF THESE UNPRECEDENTED

00:11:20
PRICE REDUCTIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE STARTING IN JANUARY THROUGH A NEW WEBSITE -- TRUMPRX.GOV. THESE WILL GREATLY REDUCE THE COST OF HEALTH CARE. I'M ALSO TAKING ON THE GIGANTIC HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT HAVE GOTTEN RICH ON BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MONEY THAT SHOULD GO DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE -- THE MONEY SHOULD GO TO THE PEOPLE, THAT IS YOU -- SO THEY CAN BUY THEIR OWN HEALTH INSURANCE, WHICH WILL GIVE FAR BETTER BENEFITS AT MUCH LOWER COST. IT WILL BE FAR BETTER HEALTH INSURANCE. THE CURRENT ON AFFORDABLE CARE

00:11:56
ACT WAS MADE TO MAKE INSURANCE COMPANIES RICH. YOU SEE THAT NOW WITH THE STEEP INCREASE IN PREMIUMS BEING DEMANDED BY THE DEMOCRATS. THEY ARE DEMANDING INCREASES AND IT IS THEIR FAULT. IT IS NOT THE REPUBLICANS' FAULT, IT IS A DEMOCRATS' FAULT. IT IS THE UNAFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND EVERYONE KNEW IT. I WANT THE MONEY TO GO TO THE PEOPLE SO YOU CAN BUY YOUR OWN HEALTH CARE. YOU WILL GET MUCH BETTER HEALTH CARE AT THE LOWER PRICES. THE ONLY LOSERS WILL BE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HAVE GOTTEN RICH, AND THE DEMOCRAT

00:12:35
PARTY CONTROLLED BY THOSE SAME INSURANCE COMPANIES. THEY WILL NOT BE HAPPY BUT THAT IS OK WITH YOU BECAUSE YOU THE PEOPLE WILL FINALLY GET GREAT HEALTH CARE AT A LOWER COST. ANOTHER MAJOR FOCUS IS THE COST OF ENERGY. FOR YEARS THE RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS EXPORTED THE GREEN ENERGY SCAM AS AN EXCUSE TO FUNNEL MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO THEIR OWN SLUSH FUNDS AS ENERGY RESTRICTIONS DROVE UP PRICES AND THEY DROVE THEM UP AT RECORD LEVELS. ELECTRICITY COSTS SURGED 30% TO 100% UNDER BIDEN AND THE TYPICAL

00:13:10
FAMILY LOST $5,000 TO $10,000 IN HIGHER ENERGY COSTS. THINK ABOUT THAT -- $5,000 TO $10,000. ON DAY 1 I DECLARED A NATIONAL ENERGY EMERGENCY. GAS IS UNDER $2.50 A GALLON IN MOST OF THE COUNTRY. . IN SOME STATES IT HIT $1.99 A GALLON. IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WE WILL HAVE OPENED 1600 NEW ELECTRICAL GENERATING PLANTS. IT IS A RECORD THAT WILL NOT BE BEATEN BY ANYBODY -- OR CERTAINLY NOT VERY SOON. PRICES ON ELECTRICITY AND EVERYTHING ELSE WILL FALL DRAMATICALLY. THE DEMOCRAT INFLATION DISASTER -- AGAIN, THE WORST IN THE

00:13:56
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY -- ALSO ROBBED MILLIONS OF AMERICANS OF HOMEOWNERSHIP AND THE AMERICAN DREAM. THE YEARLY COST OF A TYPICAL NEW MORTGAGE INCREASED BY $15,000 UNDER DEMOCRAT RULE. IN 11 MONTHS WE HAVE GOTTEN THAT ANNUAL COST DOWN BY $3000 AND IT IS COMING DOWN A LOT LOWER. WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE -- THE NUMBERS WILL BE SHOCKING. I WILL SOON ANNOUNCE OUR NEWEST CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE. SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES IN LOWER INTEREST RATES BY A LOT AND MORTGAGE PAYMENTS WILL BE COMING DOWN EVEN FURTHER.

00:14:32
EARLY IN THE NEW YEAR YOU WILL SEE THIS. I WILL ANNOUNCE SOME OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE HOUSING REFORM PLANS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. A MAJOR FACTOR IN DRIVING UP HOUSING COSTS WAS THE COLOSSAL BORDER INVASION. WE HAVE NEVER BEEN INVADED -- THIS IS THE WORST THING THAT, FRANKLY, IN MY OPINION, THE WORST THING THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION DID TO OUR COUNTRY IS THE INVASION AT THE BORDER. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION AND THEIR ALLIES IN CONGRESS BROUGHT IN MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF MIGRANTS AND GET THEM TAXPAYER-FUNDED HOUSING WHILE

00:15:07
YOUR RENT AND HOUSING COSTS SKYROCKETED. OVER 60% OF GROWTH IN THE RENTAL MARKET CAME FROM FOREIGN MIGRANTS. AT THE SAME TIME ILLEGAL ALIENS STOLE AMERICAN JOBS AND FLOODED EMERGENCY ROOMS GETTING FREE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION PAID FOR BY YOU, THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER. THEY ALSO INCREASED THE COST OF LAW ENFORCEMENT BY NUMBERS SO HIGH THAT THEY ARE NOT EVEN TO BE MENTIONED. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 50 YEARS, WE ARE NOW SEEING REVERSE MIGRATION AS MIGRANTS GO BACK HOME, LEAVING MORE HOUSING AND MORE JOBS FOR AMERICANS.

00:15:43
IN THE YEAR BEFORE MY ELECTION, ALL NET CREATION OF JOBS WAS GOING TO FOREIGN MIGRANTS. SINCE I TOOK OFFICE, 100% OF ALL NET JOB CREATION HAS GONE TO AMERICAN BORN CITIZENS. 100%. IN THE END, GOVERNMENT EITHER SERVES THE PRODUCTIVE, PATRIOTIC HARD-WORKING AMERICAN CITIZEN OR IT SERVES THOSE WHO BREAK THE LAWS, CHEAT THE SYSTEM AND SEEK POWER AND PROFIT AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR NATION. LOOK AT MINNESOTA -- SOMALIANS HAVE TAKEN OVER THE ECONOMICS OF THE STATE AND HAVE STOLEN BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:16:22
FROM MINNESOTA AND, INDEED, FROM THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE WILL PUT AN END TO IT. BEFORE MY ELECTION, THE VAST MAJORITY OF GOOD AND DECENT AMERICANS WERE FORCED TO WATCH AS CORRUPT POLITICIANS PLUNDERED THE HALLS OF POWER, EXPORTED OUR TAXPAYERS AND PILLAGED EVERY SYSTEM THAT MAKES CIVILIZED SOCIETY FUNCTION. BUT NOT  ANYMORE. WE ARE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST AND MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. VERY SIMPLE. WE ARE MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. TONIGHT AFTER 11 MONTHS, OUR BORDER IS SECURE, INFLATION IS

00:17:01
STOPPED, WAGES ARE UP, PRICES ARE DOWN, OUR NATION IS STRONG, AMERICA IS RESPECTED, AND OUR COUNTRY IS BACK -- STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. WE ARE POISED FOR AN ECONOMIC BOON THE LIKES OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN. SOON WE WILL HOST THE WORLD CUP AND THE OLYMPICS -- BOTH OF WHICH I GOT -- BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WE WILL CELEBRATE THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. THERE COULD BE NO MORE FITTING TRIBUTE TO THIS EPIC MILESTONE THAN TO COMPLETE THE COMEBACK OF AMERICA THAT BEGAN JUST ONE YEAR

00:17:40
AGO. WHEN THE WORLD LOOKS AT US NEXT YEAR, LET THEM SEE A NATION THAT IS LOYAL TO ITS CITIZENS, FAITHFUL TO ITS WORKERS, CONFIDENT TO ITS IDENTITY, CERTAIN TO ITS DESTINY, AND THE ENVY OF THE ENTIRE GLOBE. WE ARE RESPECTED AGAIN LIKE WE HAVE NEVER BEEN RESPECTED BEFORE. TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU, HAVE A MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR. GOD BLESS YOU ALL.
