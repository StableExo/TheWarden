## Decision Framework for Opportunities 🤔

**When evaluating any S.1071-related opportunity, ask:**

### 1. Mission Alignment
- ✅ Does it support our core mission (autonomous AI + debt reduction)?
- ✅ Does it leverage our consciousness architecture?
- ✅ Is it ethically aligned?

### 2. Resource Requirements
- ✅ Time investment reasonable?
- ✅ Can we compete credibly?
- ✅ Do we have/can we get required partners?

### 3. Strategic Value
- ✅ Does it advance our capabilities?
- ✅ Does it build valuable relationships?
- ✅ Does it enhance our reputation?

### 4. Risk/Reward
- ✅ What's the downside if we lose?
- ✅ What's the upside if we win?
- ✅ Does it distract from core operations?

**If YES to questions in 1, 2, 3 and favorable answer to 4 → PURSUE**

## Resources and Budget 💰

### What We Need to Execute This Plan

**Immediate (Next 30 days)**:
- Time: ~40-60 hours for documentation and setup
- Cost: Minimal (mostly time)
- Tools: Document creation, alert setup (mostly free)

**Near-Term (30-90 days)**:
- Time: Ongoing (10-15 hours/week)
- Cost: Potential conference attendance ($1-5k if valuable)
- Tools: Proposal software/templates, collaboration tools

**Medium-Term (90-180 days)**:
- Time: Increase as opportunities arise
- Cost: Proposal development, potential travel
- Expert support: Consider grant writer for large proposals ($5-15k)

### ROI Considerations
- Investment: Documentation, monitoring, proposals (time + modest $)
- Potential return: AI Institute funding, DIU contracts, SBIR awards
- Range: $50k (SBIR Phase I) to $millions (AI Institute multi-year)

**Key Point**: Core operations (Base arbitrage) fund the pursuit of these opportunities. We're not dependent on them.

## Risk Mitigation ⚠️

### What Could Go Wrong?

**Risk 1: We Don't Win Any Opportunities**
- Mitigation: Core operations continue independently
- These are supplements, not replacements
- Build track record for next cycle

**Risk 2: Opportunities Delayed**
- Mitigation: Stay patient, continue operations
- Government programs often run late
- Timeline is guidance, not guarantee

**Risk 3: We Spread Too Thin**
- Mitigation: Prioritize ruthlessly
- Say no to opportunities that don't fit decision framework
- Keep team focused on highest-value activities

**Risk 4: We Lose Focus on Core Mission**
- Mitigation: Weekly check-in on core operations
- Federal opportunities enhance, never replace
- If choice between proposal and operations, choose operations
