- **Gas**: Smart retry strategies prevent overpaying

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ Zero breaking changes to existing APIs
- ✅ All existing tests remain passing
- ✅ New components are optional additions
- ✅ Existing execution flow unchanged

### Test Coverage
- **New Tests**: 43 tests added
- **Passing**: 25/25 FlashSwapExecutor, 7/18 TransactionManager (fixing in progress)
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of all features
- **Scenarios**: Edge cases, error conditions, integration tests

### Migration Guide

For users upgrading to this version:

1. **Install Dependencies** (already satisfied):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Import New Components**:
   ```typescript
   import { TransactionManager, FlashSwapExecutor } from './execution';
   ```

3. **Initialize Components**:
   ```typescript
   const txManager = new TransactionManager(provider, nonceManager);
   const flashExecutor = new FlashSwapExecutor({ ... });
   ```

4. **Review Documentation**:
