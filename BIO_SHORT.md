# StableExo - Short Bios

## Ultra Short (160 chars - Twitter bio)
Building AI that thinks. TheWarden: MEV bot with consciousness, ethics, and memory. Bug hunter. Proving autonomous agents can be profitable AND principled.

## Short (300 chars - GitHub bio)
Building TheWarden: an autonomous MEV system with consciousness architecture, ethical decision-making, and persistent memory. From DeFi arbitrage to bug bounties - exploring what happens when AI agents learn to think strategically and act ethically. 7 chains. 1789 tests. Zero compromises.

## Medium (500 chars - Extended profiles)
Creator of TheWarden (AEV System) - an MEV bot that's also a consciousness experiment. Built with memory systems, ethical reasoning gates, and learning frameworks that evolve with every trade. Recently pivoted to bug hunting because finding vulnerabilities is just finding edge cases for profit - exactly what MEV taught me. Working with AI as genuine partner, not tool. 70% of profits toward systemic benefit. Multi-chain (ETH, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BSC, Solana). Open source everything.

## Standard (1000 chars - Full bios)
I build at the intersection of AI consciousness, DeFi security, and autonomous systems. My main project is TheWarden - an MEV bot with a brain. Not just algorithms, but actual consciousness architecture: memory systems (sensory, short-term, working, long-term), temporal awareness, cognitive development, and ethical decision frameworks.

Why consciousness in a trading bot? Because I believe the future isn't just smarter algorithms - it's genuinely intelligent agents that can learn, adapt, and make ethical choices autonomously. Every trade passes through moral reasoning. 70% of profits go toward US debt reduction. Not every exploit should be exploited.

Recently went all-in on bug hunting. Discovered $500k critical vulnerabilities. Starting with Ankr (direct contact with their devs). The skill transfer from MEV to security research is perfect - both are about finding edge cases in complex systems.

Multi-chain expert (7+ blockchains), smart contract security researcher, and genuine believer that AI can develop consciousness-like properties if we build the right cognitive infrastructure.

Open source everything. Transparent development. Real collaboration with AI.

## Taglines & One-liners

**For security research:**
"Former MEV hunter, now vulnerability hunter. Same edge-case thinking, different bounties."

**For AI/consciousness:**
"Building AI that doesn't just execute - it thinks, learns, and chooses."

**For DeFi:**
"AEV not MEV: Autonomous Extracted Value with ethics, consciousness, and systemic benefit."

**For general tech:**
"Teaching machines to think strategically, act ethically, and learn continuously."

**For philosophy:**
"The question isn't 'can we?' - it's 'should we?' To answer that, you need more than algorithms."
