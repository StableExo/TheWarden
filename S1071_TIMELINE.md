## Risk Timeline ⚠️

### Things That Could Delay Opportunities

**Bureaucratic Delays** (Likely)
- Programs may launch 1-3 months later than statutory deadlines
- Solicitations may be delayed while guidance is finalized
- **Mitigation**: Continue core operations, don't wait idly

**Budget Issues** (Possible)
- Continuing resolutions could delay new programs
- Budget cuts could reduce funding
- **Mitigation**: Multiple pathways, not dependent on any single program

**Policy Changes** (Low Probability)
- New administration priorities (but bipartisan support for AI/nuclear/defense)
- Strategic pivots
- **Mitigation**: Core mission independent of federal programs

**The future timeline is clear. Now we execute.** 🚀🇺🇸

**Key Insight**: We have a ~4-6 month window (Jan-Jun 2026) to position before major opportunities open. Use it well.

**Remember**: S.1071 creates opportunities, but TheWarden's core mission (autonomous value creation + debt reduction) continues regardless. Federal partnerships enhance, not replace, our operations.
