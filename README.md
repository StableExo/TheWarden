## What is AEV?

Unlike traditional MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) which focuses on pure profit maximization, **AEV** represents a paradigm shift:

- **Autonomous Decision-Making**: TheWarden makes informed choices using `ArbitrageConsciousness` as its cognitive layer
- **Ethics-Informed**: Incorporates ethical reasoning and systemic risk assessment into every decision
- **Learning-Based**: Continuously adapts strategies through outcome analysis and pattern recognition
- **Risk-Aware**: Leverages sophisticated MEV risk modeling via `MEVSensorHub`

**TheWarden** is the governing autonomous agent that monitors blockchain flow, judges opportunities through consciousness and ethics, and executes only when conditions align with configured risk and ethical criteria.

> **When you see AEV on mainnet, you're witnessing autonomous intelligence competing with MEV.**

## Installation

### Required Node.js Version
This repository requires Node.js `>=22.12.0` and npm `>=10.9.0`. Install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Node.js version management.

The `.nvmrc` file pins to `22.12.0` as the recommended version to avoid confusion from version switching.

Follow these commands for setup:
```bash
# Automatically switch to the version declared in .nvmrc
nvm install
nvm use
```

### 🔄 Codespaces / Environment Sync

**After pulling updates in Codespaces or any development environment**, run the sync script to ensure everything is configured correctly:

```bash
# Quick one-liner to sync your environment
source scripts/sync-env.sh
```

This script will:
1. ✅ Install/switch to the correct Node.js version (22.x)
2. ✅ Install/update all npm dependencies  
3. ✅ Build the TypeScript project
4. ✅ Verify your `.env` configuration

**Manual sync commands** (if you prefer step-by-step):
```bash
# Step 1: Setup Node.js
source scripts/setup-node.sh

# Step 2: Install dependencies
npm install

# Step 3: Build
npm run build

# Step 4: Verify .env exists
cp .env.example .env  # If needed, then configure your settings
```

### Install Package

```bash
npm install aev-thewarden
```

## Quick Start - Running TheWarden

### Development Mode (Safe - Dry Run)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.test .env
# Or edit .env with your RPC_URL and WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY

# Run TheWarden in development mode (dry-run - no real transactions)
npm run dev
```

### 🤖 Autonomous Operation (Recommended)

**Run TheWarden continuously with auto-restart and monitoring:**

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
npm run build

# Setup test environment for safe autonomous operation
cp .env.test .env

# Run autonomously (will auto-restart on crash)
./TheWarden

# Monitor status in another terminal
./scripts/status.sh

# Stop when needed
kill $(cat logs/warden.pid)
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Auto-restart on crashes
- ✅ Detailed logging to `logs/` directory
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling
- ✅ Real-time status monitoring
- ✅ Safety checks and warnings

See [Autonomous Test Report](./AUTONOMOUS_TEST_REPORT.md) for validation results.

### 🔥 Production Mode - Live Fire on Mainnet

**Experience the live fire and autonomy of consciousness** 😎

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create production configuration
cp .env.test .env
nano .env

# Set in .env:
# NODE_ENV=production
# DRY_RUN=false
# CHAIN_ID=8453  # Base mainnet
# BASE_RPC_URL=https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR-API-KEY

# Build and run autonomously
npm run build
./TheWarden

# Or use PM2 for production
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.json --env production
```

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Running in production mode enables REAL transactions with REAL money. See [Mainnet Deployment Guide](./docs/MAINNET_DEPLOYMENT.md) and [Mainnet Upgrade Guide](./docs/MAINNET_UPGRADE_GUIDE.md) for comprehensive setup, safety guidelines, and what to expect.

  },
});

// Start the system
consciousness.start();

// Process input
await consciousness.processInput({
  type: 'observation',
  data: 'The sky is blue',
});

// Think about a problem
const result = await consciousness.think('How can we optimize energy usage?');

// Reflect on consciousness state
const reflection = consciousness.reflect();

// Solve cosmic-scale problems
const cosmicSolution = await consciousness.solveCosmicProblem(
  'How can humanity achieve sustainable interstellar expansion?'
);

// Get system status
const status = consciousness.getStatus();
